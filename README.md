# pdf-2-speech
Python program to convert PDF files into MP3 files. Relies on AWS Polly for speech synthesis.

Follow the directions in the user.py file to use this program.

This is a Work In Progress and more improvements may be coming in the future.

Things I want to add:
 - Would be cool if the code could automatically add the mp3 files to apple music 
 - Maybe turn this into a microservice that I can host in AWS and access via a webapp
