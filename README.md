# pdf-2-speech
Python program to convert PDF files into MP3 files. Relies on AWS Polly for speech synthesis.

Follow the directions in the user.py file to use this program.

This is a Work In Progress and more improvements may be coming in the future.

Things I want to add:
 - Automatically make a new apple music playlist and add the mp3 files to it
 - Set up a webapp microservice hosted in AWS
